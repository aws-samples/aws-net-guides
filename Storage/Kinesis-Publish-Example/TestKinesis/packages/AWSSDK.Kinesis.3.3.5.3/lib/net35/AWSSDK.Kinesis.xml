            Creates a Kinesis data stream. A stream captures and transports data records that
            are continuously emitted from different data sources or <i>producers</i>. Scale-out
            within a stream is explicitly supported by means of shards, which are uniquely identified
            groups of data records in a stream.
            
             
            <para>
            You specify and control the number of shards that a stream is composed of. Each shard
            can support reads up to five transactions per second, up to a maximum data read total
            of 2 MB per second. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second,
            up to a maximum data write total of 1 MB per second. If the amount of data input increases
            or decreases, you can add or remove shards.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to the AWS account used
            by the application. It is also scoped by AWS Region. That is, two streams in two different
            accounts can have the same name, and two streams in the same account, but in two different
            Regions, can have the same name.

             <code>CreateStream</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a <code>CreateStream</code>
            request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns and sets the stream status to <code>CREATING</code>.
            After the stream is created, Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to <code>ACTIVE</code>.
            You should perform read and write operations only on an <code>ACTIVE</code> stream.

            Specify a shard iterator using the <code>ShardIterator</code> parameter. The shard
            iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading
            data records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the
            shard that the iterator points to, <a>GetRecords</a> returns an empty list. It might
            take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains records.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You can scale by provisioning multiple shards per stream while considering service
            limits (for more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html">Amazon
            Kinesis Data Streams Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>).
            Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading continuously from
            its stream. To read from a stream continually, call <a>GetRecords</a> in a loop. Use
            <a>GetShardIterator</a> to get the shard iterator to specify in the first <a>GetRecords</a>
            call. <a>GetRecords</a> returns a new shard iterator in <code>NextShardIterator</code>.
            Specify the shard iterator returned in <code>NextShardIterator</code> in subsequent
            calls to <a>GetRecords</a>. If the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can't
            return more data and <a>GetRecords</a> returns <code>null</code> in <code>NextShardIterator</code>.
            You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches
            the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record
            to process.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            Each data record can be up to 1 MB in size, and each shard can read up to 2 MB per
            second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum supported size or
            throughput by using the <code>Limit</code> parameter to specify the maximum number
            of records that <a>GetRecords</a> can return. Consider your average record size when
            determining this limit.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The size of the data returned by <a>GetRecords</a> varies depending on the utilization
            of the shard. The maximum size of data that <a>GetRecords</a> can return is 10 MB.
            If a call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls made within the next five
            seconds throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. If there is insufficient
            provisioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within the next one second
            throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. <a>GetRecords</a> won't
            return any data when it throws an exception. For this reason, we recommend that you
            wait one second between calls to <a>GetRecords</a>; however, it's possible that the
            application will get exceptions for longer than 1 second.

            To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can use the
            <code>MillisBehindLatest</code> response attribute. You can also monitor the stream
            using CloudWatch metrics and other mechanisms (see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/monitoring.html">Monitoring</a>
            in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>).

            Each Amazon Kinesis record includes a value, <code>ApproximateArrivalTimestamp</code>,
            that is set when a stream successfully receives and stores a record. This is commonly
            referred to as a server-side time stamp, whereas a client-side time stamp is set when
            a data producer creates or sends the record to a stream (a data producer is any data
            source putting data records into a stream, for example with <a>PutRecords</a>). The
            time stamp has millisecond precision. There are no guarantees about the time stamp
            accuracy, or that the time stamp is always increasing. For example, records in a shard
            or across a stream might have time stamps that are out of order.

            <para>
            A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records
            sequentially. The position is specified using the sequence number of a data record
            in a shard. A sequence number is the identifier associated with every record ingested
            in the stream, and is assigned when a record is put into the stream. Each stream has
            one or more shards.

            <para>
            You must specify the shard iterator type. For example, you can set the <code>ShardIteratorType</code>
            parameter to read exactly from the position denoted by a specific sequence number
            by using the <code>AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code> shard iterator type. Alternatively, the
            parameter can read right after the sequence number by using the <code>AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code>
            shard iterator type, using sequence numbers returned by earlier calls to <a>PutRecord</a>,
            <a>PutRecords</a>, <a>GetRecords</a>, or <a>DescribeStream</a>. In the request, you
            can specify the shard iterator type <code>AT_TIMESTAMP</code> to read records from
            an arbitrary point in time, <code>TRIM_HORIZON</code> to cause <code>ShardIterator</code>
            to point to the last untrimmed record in the shard in the system (the oldest data
            record in the shard), or <code>LATEST</code> so that you always read the most recent

            reads use the shard iterator returned by the <a>GetRecords</a> request in <code>NextShardIterator</code>.
            A new shard iterator is returned by every <a>GetRecords</a> request in <code>NextShardIterator</code>,

            Merges two adjacent shards in a Kinesis data stream and combines them into a single
            shard to reduce the stream's capacity to ingest and transport data. Two shards are
            considered adjacent if the union of the hash key ranges for the two shards form a

            could merge these two shards into a single shard that would have a hash key range
            of 276...454. After the merge, the single child shard receives data for all hash key

            The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data across shards.
            Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple
            shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine the
            shard to which a given data record belongs.

            <para>
            Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters
            for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer
            values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the
            shards. You can override hashing the partition key to determine the shard by explicitly
            specifying a hash value using the <code>ExplicitHashKey</code> parameter. For more
            information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream">Adding

            Container for the parameters to the SplitShard operation.
            Splits a shard into two new shards in the Kinesis data stream, to increase the stream's
            capacity to ingest and transport data. <code>SplitShard</code> is called when there
            is a need to increase the overall capacity of a stream because of an expected increase
            in the volume of data records being ingested. 
            
             
            <para>
            You can also use <code>SplitShard</code> when a shard appears to be approaching its
            maximum utilization; for example, the producers sending data into the specific shard
            are suddenly sending more than previously anticipated. You can also call <code>SplitShard</code>
            to increase stream capacity, so that more Kinesis Data Streams applications can simultaneously
            read data from the stream for real-time processing. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You must specify the shard to be split and the new hash key, which is the position
            in the shard where the shard gets split in two. In many cases, the new hash key might
            be the average of the beginning and ending hash key, but it can be any hash key value
            in the range being mapped into the shard. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-resharding-split.html">Split

             <code>SplitShard</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a <code>SplitShard</code>
            request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a response and sets the stream status
            to <code>UPDATING</code>. After the operation is completed, Kinesis Data Streams sets
            the stream status to <code>ACTIVE</code>. Read and write operations continue to work
            while the stream is in the <code>UPDATING</code> state.

            or <code>UPDATING</code> or <code>DELETING</code> states, <code>DescribeStream</code>
            returns a <code>ResourceInUseException</code>.

            A hash key value for the starting hash key of one of the child shards created by the

            of hash keys being mapped into the shard. The <code>NewStartingHashKey</code> hash
            key value and all higher hash key values in hash key range are distributed to one
            of the child shards. All the lower hash key values in the range are distributed to
            the other child shard.

            Starting encryption is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request, Kinesis
            Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to <code>UPDATING</code>.
            After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the status of the stream back
            to <code>ACTIVE</code>. Updating or applying encryption normally takes a few seconds
            to complete, but it can take minutes. You can continue to read and write data to your
            stream while its status is <code>UPDATING</code>. Once the status of the stream is
            <code>ACTIVE</code>, encryption begins for records written to the stream.

            Container for the parameters to the UpdateShardCount operation.
            Updates the shard count of the specified stream to the specified number of shards.
            
             
            <para>
            Updating the shard count is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request,
            Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to <code>UPDATING</code>.
            After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the status of the stream back
            to <code>ACTIVE</code>. Depending on the size of the stream, the scaling action could
            take a few minutes to complete. You can continue to read and write data to your stream
            while its status is <code>UPDATING</code>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To update the shard count, Kinesis Data Streams performs splits or merges on individual
            shards. This can cause short-lived shards to be created, in addition to the final
            shards. We recommend that you double or halve the shard count, as this results in
            the fewest number of splits or merges.

            Creates a Kinesis data stream. A stream captures and transports data records that
            are continuously emitted from different data sources or <i>producers</i>. Scale-out
            within a stream is explicitly supported by means of shards, which are uniquely identified
            groups of data records in a stream.
            
             
            <para>
            You specify and control the number of shards that a stream is composed of. Each shard
            can support reads up to five transactions per second, up to a maximum data read total
            of 2 MB per second. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second,
            up to a maximum data write total of 1 MB per second. If the amount of data input increases
            or decreases, you can add or remove shards.

            The stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to the AWS account used

            accounts can have the same name, and two streams in the same account, but in two different
            Regions, can have the same name.

             <code>CreateStream</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a <code>CreateStream</code>
            request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns and sets the stream status to <code>CREATING</code>.
            After the stream is created, Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to <code>ACTIVE</code>.
            You should perform read and write operations only on an <code>ACTIVE</code> stream.

            Gets data records from a Kinesis data stream's shard.
            
             
            <para>
            Specify a shard iterator using the <code>ShardIterator</code> parameter. The shard
            iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading
            data records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the
            shard that the iterator points to, <a>GetRecords</a> returns an empty list. It might
            take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains records.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You can scale by provisioning multiple shards per stream while considering service
            limits (for more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html">Amazon
            Kinesis Data Streams Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>).
            Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading continuously from
            its stream. To read from a stream continually, call <a>GetRecords</a> in a loop. Use
            <a>GetShardIterator</a> to get the shard iterator to specify in the first <a>GetRecords</a>
            call. <a>GetRecords</a> returns a new shard iterator in <code>NextShardIterator</code>.
            Specify the shard iterator returned in <code>NextShardIterator</code> in subsequent
            calls to <a>GetRecords</a>. If the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can't
            return more data and <a>GetRecords</a> returns <code>null</code> in <code>NextShardIterator</code>.
            You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches
            the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record
            to process.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            Each data record can be up to 1 MB in size, and each shard can read up to 2 MB per
            second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum supported size or
            throughput by using the <code>Limit</code> parameter to specify the maximum number
            of records that <a>GetRecords</a> can return. Consider your average record size when
            determining this limit.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The size of the data returned by <a>GetRecords</a> varies depending on the utilization
            of the shard. The maximum size of data that <a>GetRecords</a> can return is 10 MB.
            If a call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls made within the next five
            seconds throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. If there is insufficient
            provisioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within the next one second
            throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. <a>GetRecords</a> won't
            return any data when it throws an exception. For this reason, we recommend that you
            wait one second between calls to <a>GetRecords</a>; however, it's possible that the
            application will get exceptions for longer than 1 second.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can use the
            <code>MillisBehindLatest</code> response attribute. You can also monitor the stream
            using CloudWatch metrics and other mechanisms (see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/monitoring.html">Monitoring</a>
            in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>).
            </para>
             
            <para>
            Each Amazon Kinesis record includes a value, <code>ApproximateArrivalTimestamp</code>,
            that is set when a stream successfully receives and stores a record. This is commonly
            referred to as a server-side time stamp, whereas a client-side time stamp is set when
            a data producer creates or sends the record to a stream (a data producer is any data
            source putting data records into a stream, for example with <a>PutRecords</a>). The
            time stamp has millisecond precision. There are no guarantees about the time stamp
            accuracy, or that the time stamp is always increasing. For example, records in a shard
            or across a stream might have time stamps that are out of order.

            Gets an Amazon Kinesis shard iterator. A shard iterator expires five minutes after
            it is returned to the requester.
            
             
            <para>
            A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records
            sequentially. The position is specified using the sequence number of a data record
            in a shard. A sequence number is the identifier associated with every record ingested
            in the stream, and is assigned when a record is put into the stream. Each stream has
            one or more shards.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You must specify the shard iterator type. For example, you can set the <code>ShardIteratorType</code>
            parameter to read exactly from the position denoted by a specific sequence number
            by using the <code>AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code> shard iterator type. Alternatively, the
            parameter can read right after the sequence number by using the <code>AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code>
            shard iterator type, using sequence numbers returned by earlier calls to <a>PutRecord</a>,
            <a>PutRecords</a>, <a>GetRecords</a>, or <a>DescribeStream</a>. In the request, you
            can specify the shard iterator type <code>AT_TIMESTAMP</code> to read records from
            an arbitrary point in time, <code>TRIM_HORIZON</code> to cause <code>ShardIterator</code>
            to point to the last untrimmed record in the shard in the system (the oldest data

            Merges two adjacent shards in a Kinesis data stream and combines them into a single

            considered adjacent if the union of the hash key ranges for the two shards form a
            contiguous set with no gaps. For example, if you have two shards, one with a hash

            could merge these two shards into a single shard that would have a hash key range
            of 276...454. After the merge, the single child shard receives data for all hash key
            values covered by the two parent shards.

            The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data across shards.
            Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple
            shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine the
            shard to which a given data record belongs.

            <para>
            Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters
            for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer
            values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the
            shards. You can override hashing the partition key to determine the shard by explicitly
            specifying a hash value using the <code>ExplicitHashKey</code> parameter. For more
            information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream">Adding

            The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams as input to a hash function that
            maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. An MD5 hash function
            is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data
            records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the
            same partition key map to the same shard within the stream. For more information,
            see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream">Adding

            Each record in the <code>Records</code> array may include an optional parameter, <code>ExplicitHashKey</code>,
            which overrides the partition key to shard mapping. This parameter allows a data producer
            to determine explicitly the shard where the record is stored. For more information,
            see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords">Adding

            <para>
            The <code>PutRecords</code> response includes an array of response <code>Records</code>.
            Each record in the response array directly correlates with a record in the request
            array using natural ordering, from the top to the bottom of the request and response.
            The response <code>Records</code> array always includes the same number of records
            as the request array.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The response <code>Records</code> array includes both successfully and unsuccessfully
            processed records. Kinesis Data Streams attempts to process all records in each <code>PutRecords</code>
            request. A single record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            A successfully processed record includes <code>ShardId</code> and <code>SequenceNumber</code>
            values. The <code>ShardId</code> parameter identifies the shard in the stream where
            the record is stored. The <code>SequenceNumber</code> parameter is an identifier assigned
            to the put record, unique to all records in the stream.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            An unsuccessfully processed record includes <code>ErrorCode</code> and <code>ErrorMessage</code>
            values. <code>ErrorCode</code> reflects the type of error and can be one of the following
            values: <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code> or <code>InternalFailure</code>.
            <code>ErrorMessage</code> provides more detailed information about the <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>
            exception including the account ID, stream name, and shard ID of the record that was
            throttled. For more information about partially successful responses, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords">Adding

            Splits a shard into two new shards in the Kinesis data stream, to increase the stream's

            is a need to increase the overall capacity of a stream because of an expected increase

            are suddenly sending more than previously anticipated. You can also call <code>SplitShard</code>
            to increase stream capacity, so that more Kinesis Data Streams applications can simultaneously
            read data from the stream for real-time processing.

            Updating the shard count is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request,

            After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the status of the stream back

            To update the shard count, Kinesis Data Streams performs splits or merges on individual
            shards. This can cause short-lived shards to be created, in addition to the final
            shards. We recommend that you double or halve the shard count, as this results in
            the fewest number of splits or merges.

            <summary>
            Creates a Kinesis data stream. A stream captures and transports data records that
            are continuously emitted from different data sources or <i>producers</i>. Scale-out
            within a stream is explicitly supported by means of shards, which are uniquely identified
            groups of data records in a stream.
            
             
            <para>
            You specify and control the number of shards that a stream is composed of. Each shard
            can support reads up to five transactions per second, up to a maximum data read total
            of 2 MB per second. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second,
            up to a maximum data write total of 1 MB per second. If the amount of data input increases
            or decreases, you can add or remove shards.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to the AWS account used
            by the application. It is also scoped by AWS Region. That is, two streams in two different
            accounts can have the same name, and two streams in the same account, but in two different
            Regions, can have the same name.

             <code>CreateStream</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a <code>CreateStream</code>
            request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns and sets the stream status to <code>CREATING</code>.
            After the stream is created, Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to <code>ACTIVE</code>.
            You should perform read and write operations only on an <code>ACTIVE</code> stream.

            <para>
            Specify a shard iterator using the <code>ShardIterator</code> parameter. The shard
            iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading
            data records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the
            shard that the iterator points to, <a>GetRecords</a> returns an empty list. It might
            take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains records.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You can scale by provisioning multiple shards per stream while considering service
            limits (for more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html">Amazon
            Kinesis Data Streams Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>).
            Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading continuously from
            its stream. To read from a stream continually, call <a>GetRecords</a> in a loop. Use
            <a>GetShardIterator</a> to get the shard iterator to specify in the first <a>GetRecords</a>
            call. <a>GetRecords</a> returns a new shard iterator in <code>NextShardIterator</code>.
            Specify the shard iterator returned in <code>NextShardIterator</code> in subsequent
            calls to <a>GetRecords</a>. If the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can't
            return more data and <a>GetRecords</a> returns <code>null</code> in <code>NextShardIterator</code>.
            You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches
            the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record
            to process.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            Each data record can be up to 1 MB in size, and each shard can read up to 2 MB per
            second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum supported size or
            throughput by using the <code>Limit</code> parameter to specify the maximum number
            of records that <a>GetRecords</a> can return. Consider your average record size when
            determining this limit.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The size of the data returned by <a>GetRecords</a> varies depending on the utilization
            of the shard. The maximum size of data that <a>GetRecords</a> can return is 10 MB.
            If a call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls made within the next five
            seconds throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. If there is insufficient
            provisioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within the next one second
            throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. <a>GetRecords</a> won't
            return any data when it throws an exception. For this reason, we recommend that you
            wait one second between calls to <a>GetRecords</a>; however, it's possible that the
            application will get exceptions for longer than 1 second.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can use the
            <code>MillisBehindLatest</code> response attribute. You can also monitor the stream
            using CloudWatch metrics and other mechanisms (see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/monitoring.html">Monitoring</a>
            in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>).

            Each Amazon Kinesis record includes a value, <code>ApproximateArrivalTimestamp</code>,
            that is set when a stream successfully receives and stores a record. This is commonly
            referred to as a server-side time stamp, whereas a client-side time stamp is set when
            a data producer creates or sends the record to a stream (a data producer is any data
            source putting data records into a stream, for example with <a>PutRecords</a>). The
            time stamp has millisecond precision. There are no guarantees about the time stamp
            accuracy, or that the time stamp is always increasing. For example, records in a shard
            or across a stream might have time stamps that are out of order.

            <summary>
            Gets an Amazon Kinesis shard iterator. A shard iterator expires five minutes after
            it is returned to the requester.
            
             
            <para>
            A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records
            sequentially. The position is specified using the sequence number of a data record
            in a shard. A sequence number is the identifier associated with every record ingested
            in the stream, and is assigned when a record is put into the stream. Each stream has
            one or more shards.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You must specify the shard iterator type. For example, you can set the <code>ShardIteratorType</code>
            parameter to read exactly from the position denoted by a specific sequence number
            by using the <code>AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code> shard iterator type. Alternatively, the
            parameter can read right after the sequence number by using the <code>AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code>
            shard iterator type, using sequence numbers returned by earlier calls to <a>PutRecord</a>,
            <a>PutRecords</a>, <a>GetRecords</a>, or <a>DescribeStream</a>. In the request, you
            can specify the shard iterator type <code>AT_TIMESTAMP</code> to read records from
            an arbitrary point in time, <code>TRIM_HORIZON</code> to cause <code>ShardIterator</code>
            to point to the last untrimmed record in the shard in the system (the oldest data
            record in the shard), or <code>LATEST</code> so that you always read the most recent
            data in the shard.

            <para>
            When you read repeatedly from a stream, use a <a>GetShardIterator</a> request to get
            the first shard iterator for use in your first <a>GetRecords</a> request and for subsequent
            reads use the shard iterator returned by the <a>GetRecords</a> request in <code>NextShardIterator</code>.
            A new shard iterator is returned by every <a>GetRecords</a> request in <code>NextShardIterator</code>,
            which you use in the <code>ShardIterator</code> parameter of the next <a>GetRecords</a>

            The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data across shards.
            Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple

            shard to which a given data record belongs.

            Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters

            values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the
            shards. You can override hashing the partition key to determine the shard by explicitly

            You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the
            data; and an array of request <code>Records</code>, with each record in the array
            requiring a partition key and data blob. The record size limit applies to the total

            </para>
             
            <para>
            The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location

            The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams as input to a hash function that
            maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. An MD5 hash function
            is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data
            records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the
            same partition key map to the same shard within the stream. For more information,
            see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream">Adding

            Each record in the <code>Records</code> array may include an optional parameter, <code>ExplicitHashKey</code>,
            which overrides the partition key to shard mapping. This parameter allows a data producer
            to determine explicitly the shard where the record is stored. For more information,
            see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords">Adding

            <para>
            The <code>PutRecords</code> response includes an array of response <code>Records</code>.
            Each record in the response array directly correlates with a record in the request
            array using natural ordering, from the top to the bottom of the request and response.
            The response <code>Records</code> array always includes the same number of records
            as the request array.

            <para>
            The response <code>Records</code> array includes both successfully and unsuccessfully
            processed records. Kinesis Data Streams attempts to process all records in each <code>PutRecords</code>
            request. A single record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records.

            <para>
            A successfully processed record includes <code>ShardId</code> and <code>SequenceNumber</code>
            values. The <code>ShardId</code> parameter identifies the shard in the stream where
            the record is stored. The <code>SequenceNumber</code> parameter is an identifier assigned
            to the put record, unique to all records in the stream.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            An unsuccessfully processed record includes <code>ErrorCode</code> and <code>ErrorMessage</code>
            values. <code>ErrorCode</code> reflects the type of error and can be one of the following
            values: <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code> or <code>InternalFailure</code>.
            <code>ErrorMessage</code> provides more detailed information about the <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>
            exception including the account ID, stream name, and shard ID of the record that was
            throttled. For more information about partially successful responses, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords">Adding
