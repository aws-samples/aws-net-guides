# .NET 7 support on AWS

## Overview

This guide describes .NET 7 support provided by AWS services and tools. The guide will be updated as new support is added. 
At the moment .NET 7 is still in a pre-release stage, so levels of support may change leading up to the final release.

## Introduction

The latest release of .NET 7 brings some exciting new features to .NET including performance increases, and Native AoT compilation of .net code. 
.NET 7 can be used with a number of AWS services such as ([Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)) where the runtime is installed manually. 

This guide is focused on AWS services and tools that have either been updated, or are being updated, to provide .NET 7 support. While we work to 
test and validate support for the GA release of .NET 6 to all services and tools, there are some steps you can take to use .NET 7 today. 
These are called out in the sections below. 

Please open an [Issue on this repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-net-guides/issues) with questions about .NET 7 support on AWS. 
We use this feedback to help us prioritize updates. 


## Compute Services

### Amazon EC2

Customers can install .NET 7 on over 400 [Amazon EC2 instances types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). 

The following EC2 [User Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html#user-data-console) example installs .NET 7 on a linux server.
```
#!/bin/bash
# Install .NET 7 SDK for Linux
sudo apt-get update -y
curl -O https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/253e5af8-41aa-48c6-86f1-39a51b44afdc/5bb2cb9380c5b1a7f0153e0a2775727b/dotnet-sdk-7.0.100-linux-x64.tar.gz
mkdir /usr/bin/dotnet
sudo tar -zxvf dotnet-sdk-7.0.100-linux-x64.tar.gz -C /usr/bin/dotnet
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/dotnet/dotnet /usr/bin/dotnet
sudo sh -c 'echo "export DOTNET_ROOT=/usr/bin/dotnet" >> /etc/environment'
sudo sh -c 'echo "export PATH=$PATH:$DOTNET_ROOT" >> /etc/environment'
```

Install scripts for .NET can be found here:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/scripts

Customers can use automation facilities in the [AWS Systems Manager Service](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager) to automatically install .NET runtimes using 
automation documents, and use the [EC2 Image Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/) service to precreate EC2 Images with the .NET Runtime pre-installed. 

### AWS Lambda
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) supports running .NET 7 applications in two ways. You can create your own  
[custom runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html) or you can publish native code to Lambda using .NET 7's native AOT compilation. A blog post on how to create native lambda functions is available [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-serverless-net-applications-on-aws-lambda-using-net-7/).


### Containers

AWS customers can deploy .NET applications running on either Windows or Linux containers using [Amazon Elastic Container Software](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) (ECS) and 
[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (EKS). [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) is a service that you can use to run and manage the 
lifecycle of ECS and EKS containers without the need to manage the container infrastructure yourself. 

[AWS App Runner](https://aws.amazon.com/apprunner/) is a fully managed service that makes it easy to quickly deploy containerized web applications and APIs, 
scaling up or down automatically to meet application traffic needs. To use with .NET 7 applications, upload an image with the .NET 7 application to 
[Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) (ECR) and use the [source image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/service-source-image.html) support 
to configure AWS App Runner to start, run, scale, and load balance the application. 

[AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) allows customers to package up their applications and deploy to elastic beanstalk as a container image. 
By using containers, customer can deploy .NET 7 applications on Elastic Beanstalk. 

## Tools, Libraries, and SDK

### AWS Code Build
[AWS Code Build](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) is a fully managed service to help developers automatically build applications from source code. The code build service allows the user to customize the build environment, to suit the needs of the application being built. This includes the ability to install additional .NET runtimes. Users can add support for building .NET 7 applications by adding the following snippet to their applications buildspec.yml file.

```
  install:
    commands:
      - curl -sSL https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh | bash /dev/stdin --channel STS 
```
This will automatically download an install the .NET 7 SDK as part of the Install phase of CodeBuild.


### AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio

The [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/) is an extension for Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows that makes it easier for developers to develop, debug, 
and deploy .NET applications using Amazon Web Services. Visual Studio 2022 supports .NET 7 development, and customers can download the AWS Toolkit for 
[Visual Studio 2022](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.AWSToolkitforVisualStudio2022) from the Visual Studio Marketplace.
